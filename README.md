# fraud-detector

Detecting fraudulent insurance claims using structured data and NLP techniques (XGBoost + SHAP).

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that identifies potentially fraudulent insurance claims. It combines structured data (e.g., claim amounts, customer info) and unstructured data (text descriptions) to predict the likelihood of fraud.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, XGBoost
- NLP: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF
- Explainability: SHAP values
- Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC
